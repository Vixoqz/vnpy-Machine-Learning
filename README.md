## vnpy Workspace

While the vnpy Platform is all about an integration to dozens of different data vendors, the interface is either Python or a CLI.

If you want an enterprise UI to visualize this datasets and use AI agents on top, you can find vnpy Workspace at.

* :bar_chart: **dataset**: Factor Feature Engineering

    * Designed specifically for ML algorithm training optimization, supporting efficient batch feature calculation and processing
    * Built-in rich factor feature expression calculation engine, enabling rapid one-click generation of training data
    * Alpha 158: A collection of stock market features from Microsoft's Qlib project, covering multiple dimensions of quantitative factors including K-line patterns, price trends, and time-series volatility

* :bulb: **model**: Prediction Model Training

    * Provides standardized ML model development templates, greatly simplifying model building and training processes
    * Unified API interface design, supporting seamless switching between different algorithms for performance comparison testing
    * Integrates multiple mainstream machine learning algorithms:
        * Lasso]: Classic Lasso regression model, implementing feature selection through L1 regularization
        * LightGBM: Efficient gradient boosting decision tree with a training engine optimized for large-scale datasets
        * MLP: Multi-layer perceptron neural network, suitable for modeling complex non-linear relationships



```python
import vnpy
"""
This example shows how backtest over tweets
"""

class TwitterBot(vnpy.Model):
    def main(self, args):
        while self.has_data:
            self.backtester.value_account()
            self.sleep('1h')

    def event(self, type_: str, data: str):
        # Now check if it's a tweet about Tesla
        if 'tsla' in data.lower() or 'gme' in data.lower():
            # Buy, sell or evaluate your portfolio
            pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    exchange = vnpy.Alpaca()
    model = TwitterBot(exchange)

    # Add the tweets json here
    model.backtester.add_custom_events(vnpy.data.JsonEventReader('./tweets.json'))
    # Now add some underlying prices at 1 month
    model.backtester.add_prices('TSLA', '1h', start_date='3/20/22', stop_date='4/15/22')

    # Backtest or run live
    print(model.backtest(args=None, initial_values={'USD': 10000}))

```

**Shell** - the ready-made graphical framework with the ability to quickly change to your needs and with fully open source code in C#:
  - Complete source code
  - Support for all vnpy platform connections
  - Support for S#.Designer schemas
  - Flexible user interface
  - Strategy testing (statistics, equity, reports)
  - Save and load strategy settings
  - Launch strategies in parallel
  - Detailed information on strategy performance 
  - Launch strategies on schedule

## 🛠️ Installation

In addition to the graphical start-up method based on VeighNa Station, you can also create run.py in any directory and write the following sample code:

```Python
from vnpy.event import EventEngine
from vnpy.trader.engine import MainEngine
from vnpy.trader.ui import MainWindow, create_qapp

from vnpy_ctp import CtpGateway
from vnpy_ctastrategy import CtaStrategyApp
from vnpy_ctabacktester import CtaBacktesterApp


def main():
    """Start VeighNa Trader"""
    qapp = create_qapp()

    event_engine = EventEngine()
    main_engine = MainEngine(event_engine)
    
    main_engine.add_gateway(CtpGateway)
    main_engine.add_app(CtaStrategyApp)
    main_engine.add_app(CtaBacktesterApp)

    main_window = MainWindow(main_engine, event_engine)
    main_window.showMaximized()

    qapp.exec()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
